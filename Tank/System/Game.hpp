/*!
 * \brief Static class controlling game loop, Window and World stack.
 *
 * # Game
 *
 * The Game class allows you to initialize, start and stop the game. It
 * provides control over the main game loop and the Worlds in the game.
 *
 * ## Starting a game
 *
 * To start the engine, call Game::initialize(). This will create the
 * window, and initialize rendering.
 *
 * Before starting the game, you should create a World with Game::makeWorld<>().
 * This will create a world and prepare to add it to the top of the world stack.
 * You can then call Game::run() to enter the main loop.
 *
 * Example Main.cpp:
 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
 *     int main()
 *     {
 *         if (tank::Game::initialize({windowX,windowY}, desiredFPS)) {
 *            tank::Game::makeWorld<MyMenuWorld>(); // Create a new world
 *            tank::Game::run(); // enter the game loop, which will add the
 *                               // created world to the top of the world stack
 *         }
 *     }
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * One iteration of the main loop is equivalent to a frame.
 * At the beginning of a frame, the last of any worlds created in the last frame
 * with makeWorld() will be added to the top of the world stack. If the world
 * stack is empty, the loop will exit. Otherwise, the top of the stack will
 * become the active world. The active world will then be updated and drawn.
 * Finally, if popWorld() has been called, the active world will be destroyed,
 * and the next frame will begin.
 *
 * ##Managing Worlds
 *
 * Tank currently uses a simple stack to manage worlds. In a frame, you
 * can add one world to the top of the stack, and pop the currently active
 * world from the stack, destroying it.
 *
 * In the following example, rows below **Function** represent sequential
 * function calls in that frame, while rows above **Function** represent the
 * world stack at the beginning of each frame, going from the bottom up.
 * A World item in italics indicates that it is the current world.
 *
 * |      Start        |      Frame 1      |      Frame 2       |    Frame 3        | Frame 4
 * | :---------------: | :---------------: | :----------------: | :----------:      | :-:
 * |        -          |         -         |       *Main*       |       -           |  -
 * |        -          |      *Menu*       |        Menu        |    *Menu*         |  *Main*
 * |   **Function**    |   **Function**    |    **Function**    | **Function**      | **Function**
 * | makeWorld<Main>() | makeWorld<Main>() |     popWorld()     | makeWorld<Main>() |  popWorld()
 * | makeWorld<Menu>() |         -         |     popWorld()     |   popWorld()      |  -
 *
 * There are some important things to note:
 *
 *  - only the last makeWorld() call before the next frame will add that world
 *    to the stack; however, all makeWorld calls will *create* a world,
 *    calling its constructor, but all but the last will be destroyed.
 *  - multiple calls to popWorld() have no additional effect
 *  - calling popWorld() pops the *currently active* World, regardless of
 *    whether makeWorld() has been called.
 *  - if the World stack is empty at the beginning of a frame, the game loop
 *    ends.

     * \brief A log stream.
     *
     * This acts like a standard stream (_e.g._ `std::cout`), and writes to the
     * file `log.txt` in the directory in which the game was run.
     * If `DEBUG` is defined, it also outputs to `std::clog`.
     *
     * Tank writes to Game::log when initializing and closing, so `log.txt` can
     * show you if the engine is failing at some point.
     *
     * **NB:** remember to finish your log with `std::endl`.
     *
     * Example code:
     *
     * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
     *     MyEnt() : tank::Entity({0, 0})

     *         Game::log << "Created MyEnt at position (0, 0)" << std::endl;
     *     }
     * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     * Example `log.txt`:
